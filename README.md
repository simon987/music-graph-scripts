### task_tracker setup:

Last.fm api calls are queued to [task_tracker](https://github.com/simon987/task_tracker/),
 and results are gathered by a [task_tracker_drone](https://github.com/simon987/task_tracker_drone/) 
 ([script](https://git.simon987.net/drone/last.fm/src/master/run)).


Project secret:
```json
{
	"apikey": "<Your Last.fm api key>",
	"user": "<Your Last.fm username>"
}
```
